# Intermediate Software Development Automated Teller Project

This project will be developed over the course of several assignments.  Each assignment will build on the work done in the previous assignment(s).  Ultimately, an entire system will be created to manage bank transactions for clients who have one or more bank accounts.

## Assignment

Assignment 1: In this assignment you will leverage the knowledge gained in Module 01 to develop classes to support a larger system. This is the first of many assignments in this course, each of which will build on the previous assignment in order to produce a complete system. The focus of this assignment aligns with the focus of the first module - that is, classes, encapsulation and unit test planning.

Assignment 2: This assignment will extend the BankAccount class created in your previous assignment. The BankAccount class will be used as a superclass from which more specific subclasses will be derived. Each subclass will inherit attributes and methods from the superclass, and will incorporate functionality specific to the subclass. Polymorphism will be realized by having each subclass provide their own unique implementation to a superclass method. Unit testing in this assignment will be limited to verifying the expected polymorphic behaviour.

## Encapsulation

[use this section to explain how Encapsulation was achieved in the BankAccount class.]
